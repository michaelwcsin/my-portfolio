My Portfolio

Welcome to my page.

- Inspired by JavaScript Mastery.

- Components brought from Aceternity UI & customized to fit my needs.
- SVGs used from icon8.com & figma.

TO-DO's:

  - change about me to get smaller
  - icon cloud to be smaller
  - under construction text to be smaller
  - carousel to be bigger
  - contact icons smaller
