My Portfolio

Welcome to my page.

- Inspired by JavaScript Mastery.
- First experience with Next.JS & TS, but a fun challenge in developing my portfolio.
- Components brought from Aceternity UI & customized to fit my needs.
- SVGs used from icon8.com & figma.

TO-DO's:

- Choose a different font.
- Personalize Bento Grid more.
- Research different UI libraries and see what works best.
